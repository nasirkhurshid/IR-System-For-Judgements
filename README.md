# IR-System-For-Judgements
The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is rapidly growing, with
applications in various domains including law. NLP can help lawyers,
judges, and researchers analyze large volumes of legal documents and
extract insights. This project aims to apply NLP techniques to legal
judgments from the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which have a significant
impact on the legal system and society. While these judgments are available
on the court's website, they are in unstructured text format and can be
difficult to analyze manually. An Information Retrieval System has been
developed to assist lawyers in finding relevant judgments based on their
queries. This will enhance their efficiency and effectiveness by simplifying
the process of searching for relevant information.
